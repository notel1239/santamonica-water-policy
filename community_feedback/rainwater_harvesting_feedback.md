# Feedback Request: Incentives for Residential Rainwater Harvesting

**Label:** community-feedback

We are seeking community feedback on proposed incentives for residential rainwater harvesting systems. Please share your thoughts on:

- What types of rebates or tax credits would be most effective?
- Should the city provide technical assistance for installation?
- How can we ensure equitable access to these incentives across all neighborhoods?

This simulated issue represents a GitHub Issue that would be used for community engagement.
