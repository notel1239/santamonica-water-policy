# Feedback Request: Regulations for Commercial Water Fountains

**Label:** community-feedback

We are seeking community feedback on proposed regulations for commercial water fountains. Please share your thoughts on:

- Should all new ornamental fountains be required to use recirculating systems?
- What water-saving controls (e.g., timers, sensors) should be mandated?
- Are there exceptions that should be considered for historical or artistic fountains?

This simulated issue represents a GitHub Issue that would be used for community engagement.
